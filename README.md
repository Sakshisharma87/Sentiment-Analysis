# ðŸŽ¬ Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews (LSTM-based) â€“ *In Progress*

A deep learning-based sentiment analysis model using **Bidirectional LSTM** to classify movie reviews as **positive** or **negative**. Built using TensorFlow/Keras, this model is trained on the full **IMDB dataset (50,000 reviews)** to maximize accuracy and robustness.

> ðŸš§ This project is currently under development. More features and improvements are planned.
